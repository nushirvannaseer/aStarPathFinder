**Ambulance Route Planning Simulator**

This simulator uses the offline/static version of the A* star algorithm to find a path from one point to another in a randomly generated maze.

- The simulator was designed by following a tutorial on YouTube, created by Tech with Tim. Basic understanding of PyGame was acquired using that.

***Pre-Requisites***
- Python 3
- PyGame. Can be installed using:
        
        pip3 install pygame
- TKinter. Can be installed using:

        pip3 install tk

***How to use***
- Type the following into a terminal or command prompt:
            
        python3 ambulance.py
- Click anywhere to add a starting point
- Click a second time to add an ending point
- Press Enter to find a path

The green squares represent open nodes, whereas the red squares represent closed ones. The path, once found is shown in purple.
